# 1. Data Collection:
* Define the problem and objectives.
* Identify data sources.
* Collect raw data.
* Ensure data privacy and compliance.

# 2. Data Exploration:
* Load the data into a suitable environment (e.g., Pandas DataFrame).
* Understand the structure and content of the data (e.g., data types, shape).
* Visualize the data using plots and charts.

# 3. Data Cleaning:
*  Handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
*  Detect and remove duplicates.
*  Handle outliers.
*  Correct data entry errors.

# 4. Data Transformation
* Normalize or standardize numerical features.
* Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
* Convert data types if necessary.
* Create new features if applicable.

# 5. Feature Selection
* Identify and select relevant features.
* Remove irrelevant or redundant features.
* Use feature importance techniques (e.g., correlation, mutual information, feature importance from models).

# 6. Data Splitting
* Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
* Ensure that the splits are representative of the overall dataset.
* Consider stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets.

# 7. Data Augmentation
* Apply data augmentation techniques if applicable (e.g., for image or text data).
* Ensure augmented data is realistic and relevant.

# 8. Data Resampling
* Address class imbalance if necessary (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE).

# 9. Data Integration
* Merge data from different sources if applicable.
* Ensure consistency across merged datasets.

# 10. Data Anonymization
* Anonymize sensitive data if required.
* Ensure that anonymization does not affect the utility of the data.

# 11. Data Quality Assessment
* Assess the overall quality of the data.
* Check for data leakage.
* Ensure that the data is consistent and reliable.
